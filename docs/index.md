This site hosts the documentation on **how to run an IPAC conference 
with [Indico](https://getindico.io)**.

The workflow follows the one well documented in the [Organizing IPACs (and other JACoW Events)](https://www.jacow.org/Editors/RunningJACoWConference)  hosted on the official [Joint Accelerator Conferences Website (JACoW)](https://www.JACoW.org).

As per the original document, the documentation is split in various chapters following 
the normal IPAC workflow (e.g., *Initial setup*, *Proposals for Invited Contributions*, *General abstract submission*, etc.).
However, an approach based on the *type of user* following the instructions has been chosen, as highlighted by the structure of the tree menu on the left.
