In MEOW, there are several events, each serving a specific purpose:

- **Abstract Booklet**
- **PDF Check**
- **Proceedings**:
    - Pre-press proceedings
    - Final proceedings
    - Compression 
- **DOI**:
    - DOI info fetching
    - DOI drafting
    - DOI publishing
    - DOI deletion
    - DOI hiding

Each event is comprised of a sequence of asynchronous tasks aimed at achieving a particular goal. For instance, these tasks can include generating the "Abstract Booklet" document or creating the "Final proceedings." Execution proceeds sequentially, with each task completed before moving on to the next.
