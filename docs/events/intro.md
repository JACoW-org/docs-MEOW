There are several events in MEOW:

- Abstract Booklet
- PDF Check
- Proceedings:
    - Pre-press proceedings
    - Final proceedings
    - Compression 
- DOI:
    - DOI info fetching
    - DOI drafting
    - DOI publishing
    - DOI deletion
    - DOI hiding

Every event consists of a sequence of tasks to be exploited in order to achieve a goal, like for example the generation of the "Abstract Booklet" document or the generation of the "Final proceedings". These tasks are asynchronous functions and the execution proceeds only when the current task is completed.
